        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello Everyone , My name is Khashayar Mirbabaie, I know the name might be a bit hard to pronouns.</p>
        <p>I am 32 years old and I'm from Iran , Tehran. Tehran is the capital city of Iran and it is very crowded city.Iran is a country of lots of cultures and history , you will never be bored of visiting this country.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I have bachelor degree of Computer Engineering but you never learn enough from universities , as far as I have experienced. so I started with youtube first to see what is it about to be a web developer , then I chose to go for Front-End developing , however I would love to become very experience with Back-End aswell but one of the important lessons I have learned in life is <strong>"Step By Step"</strong> , because I was not considering this simple rule I have failed at many parts of my life due to reaching out my targets in the shortest time possible and in most cases it wont be a good idea.</p>
        <p>
        After my first 2 months of learning HTML and CSS , I was lucky because a friend of mine, introduced  <strong><a id="treehouse" href="https://www.teamtreehouse.com" target="_blank">www.teamtreehouse.com</a></strong> to me and i cannot say how amazed I became by then , a website with very organized and well recorded videos , great community and teachers , so I started the full course for Front-End Developer and managed to finish it in 6months .  currently I am their TechDegree Student doing projects in order to become more experienced than I am at the moment. </p>
